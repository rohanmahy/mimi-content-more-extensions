1.  Introduction

   This document defines a set of new fields for the MIMI content
   [I-D.ietf-mimi-content] format extensions map.  These particular
   extensions were chosen to provide functionality already in some other
   messaging systems, so that they can carry this information safely
   with the MIMI content format.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Sender Timestamp Extension

   This extension represents the sender asserted sending timestamp.  It
   is a map containing the whole number of seconds since the start of
   the UNIX epoch, and optionally the number of additional milliseconds,
   microseconds, or nanoseconds.

   /sender_timestamp/  3: {
       /seconds since UNIX epoch/  1: 1762760377,
       /microseconds/             -6: 462917
   }

   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) [RFC8610] description of
   the extension is below.

   $$otherKnownExtensions //= (
     &(senderTimestamp: TBD1) ^ => {
       1: uint,
       ? fractional
     }
   )
   fractional = ( -3: millisecs // -6: microsecs // -9: nanosecs)
   millisecs = 0..999
   microsecs = 0..999999
   nanosecs  = 0..999999999

   TBD1 = 3  ; recommended value for IANA

4.  External Message ID Extension

   While the MIMI content format has its own message ID derived from a
   hash of its content, many messaging systems already have a native
   message ID format.  This extension allows this "external" message ID
   to also be included in the MIMI content extensions map.

   It consists of an array of two parts, a byte string for the native
   message ID, and a scope.  The scope could be be an Internet domain
   name (represented as a text string), a tagged URI, or an IANA-
   registered Private Enterprise Number (PEN), which is a positive
   integer.  The PEN option allows for a concise, but unambiguous scope
   in many organizations.

   4: [h'08bbeeb8175c4a64a8926a5a23bb2811', 311]

   The CDDL description is below.

   $$otherKnownExtensions //= (
     &(externalMessageId: TBD2) ^ => ExtMessageId
   )
   ExtMessageId = [ bstr, scope ]
   scope = pen / domain / uri
   pen = uint .gt 0    ; IANA Private Enterprise Number
   domain = tstr       ; Internet domain name

   TBD2 = 4

5.  Subject Extension

   The subject extension allows messaging systems which already have a
   Subject field to carry a text string of up to 4096 octets of legal
   UTF-8.

   5: "This space intentionally left blank"

   The CDDL description is below.

   $$otherKnownExtensions //= (
     &(subject: TBD3) ^ => tstr .size (1..4096)
   )

   TBD3 = 5

6.  Message Ordering via lastSeen

   The lastSeen data field indicates the latest message(s) the sender
   was aware of in the group.  It is a list of MIMI message IDs, or a
   list of external message IDs.

   If the sender recently joined the group and has not yet seen any
   messages, the list is empty.

   If the sender identifies a single message as unambiguously the latest
   message in the group, the lastSeen list contains a single message id
   from that message.

   Imagine however that two users (Bob and Cathy) see a message from
   Alice offering free Hawaiian pizza, and reply at the same time.  Bob
   and Cathy both send messages with their lastSeen including a single
   message id (Alice's message about pizza).  Their messages don't need
   to be replies or reactions.  Bob might just send a message saying he
   doesn't like pineapple on pizza.  Now Doug receives all these
   messages and replies as well.  Doug's message contains a lastSeen
   including the message id list of both Bob's and Cathy's replies,
   effectively "merging" the order of messages.

   The next message after Doug's message contains a lastSeen containing
   only the message id of Doug's message.

   The CDDL description is below.

   $$otherKnownExtensions //= (
     &(lastSeen: TBD4) ^ => [ * MessageId ] / [ * ExtMessageId ]
   )

   TBD4 = 256
