1.  Introduction

   This document defines ome MIMI content

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Sender Timestamp Extension

   /sender_timestamp/  3: {
       /seconds since UNIX epoch/  1: 1762760377,
       /microseconds/             -6: 462917
   }

   sender_timestamp = {
     TBD1: {
       1: uint,
       ? fractional
     }
   }

   fractional = ( -3: millisecs / -6: microsecs / -9: nanosecs)
   millisecs = 0..999
   microsecs = 0..999999
   nanosecs  = 0..999999999

   TBD1 = 3  ; recommended value for IANA

4.  External Message ID Extension

   Many messaging systems already have a native message ID format.

   external_message_id = {
     TBD2: ExtMessageId
   }

   ExtMessageId = [ bstr, scope ]
   scope = pen / domain / uri
   pen = uint .gt 0 ; IANA Private Enterprise Number
   domain = tstr    ; Internet domain name

   TBD2 = 4

5.  Subject Extension

   subject = {
     TBD3: tstr .size 1..4096
   }

   TBD3 = 5

6.  Message Ordering via lastSeen

   The lastSeen data field indicates the latest message the sender was
   aware of in the group.  It is a list of MIMI message IDs, or a list
   of external message IDs.

   If the sender recently joined the group and has not yet seen any
   messages, the list is empty.

   If the sender identifies a single message as unambiguously the latest
   message in the group, the lastSeen list contains a single message id
   from that message.

   Imagine however that two users (Bob and Cathy) see a message from
   Alice offering free Hawaiian pizza, and reply at the same time.  Bob
   and Cathy both send messages with their lastSeen including a single
   message id (Alice's) message about pizza.  Their messages don't need
   to be replies or reactions.  Bob might just send a message saying he
   doesn't like pineapple on pizza.  Now Doug receives all these
   messages and replies as well.  Doug's message contains a lastSeen
   including the message id list of both Bob's and Cathy's replies,
   effectively "merging" the order of messages.

   The next message after Doug's message contains a lastSeen containing
   only the message id of Doug's message.

   ordering = {
     TBD4: [ * MessageId ] / [ * ExtMessageId ]
   }

   TBD4 = 256

7.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
